MacDown is an open source Markdown editor for OS X, released under the MIT License. The author stole the idea from [Chen Luo](https://twitter.com/chenluois)â€™s [Mou](http://mouapp.com) so that people can [make crappy clones](https://twitter.com/remaerd/status/484914820408279040).

## Development

If you wish to build MacDown yourself, you will need Git and [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org). After you clone the repository, run the following command inside the repository root (directory containing this `README.md` file):

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
pod install
```

and open `MacDown.xcworkspace` in Xcode. The first two commands intialise the dependency submodule(s) used in MacDown; the last one installs dependencies managed by Cocoapods.

Refer to the official guides of Git and Cocoapods if you need more instructions. If you run into build issues, try running `git submodule update` and `pod install` again to update the dependencies.
